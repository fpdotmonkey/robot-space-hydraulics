  abstract  = {Many arachnids use internal hemolymph pressure to actuate extension in their leg joints. The inherent large foot displacement-to-body length ratio that arachnids can achieve through hydraulics relative to muscle-based actuators is both energy and volumetrically efficient. Until recent advances in nano/microscale 3D printing with two-photon polymerization (2PP), the physical realization of synthetic complex ‘soft’ joints would have been impossible to replicate and fill with a hydraulic fluid into a sealed sub-millimeter system. Inspired by nature, the smallest scale 3D-printed hydraulic actuator (4.9 × 10−4 mm3) by more than an order of magnitude is demonstrated. The use of stiff 2PP polymers with micron-scale dimensions enable compliant membranes similar to exoskeletons seen in nature without the requirement for low-modulus materials. The bio-inspired system is designed to mimic similar hydraulic pressure-activated mechanisms in arachnid joints utilized for large displacement motions relative to body length. Using variations on this actuator design, the ability to transmit forces with relatively large magnitudes (milliNewtons) in 3D space is demonstrated, as well as the ability to direct motion that is useful towards microrobotics and medical applications. Microscale hydraulic actuation provides a promising approach toward the transmission of large forces and 3D motions at small scales, previously unattainable in wafer-level 2D microelecromechanical systems (MEMS).},

The stream of two-phase flow causes troubles for hydraulic calculation of cryogenic pipeline. There are three main types of cryogenic flow in the pipelines. First type is characterized with quite equal distribution of liquid throughout stream phase of gas (homogenous gas-liquid mixture), second type – with the structure of gas and fluid in separate layers, and the third one – with the motion of fluid in the ring part of pipe walls and high speed of gas in its central part.
The paper offers a calculation formula for the estimation of hydraulic resistance (losses) for hydraulic calculation of multi-phase cryogenic pipelines in the presence of thermal exchange with environment when pressure losses are associated with the force of gravity and friction.},

  abstract  = {Cavitation occurs as the fluid pressure is lower than the vapor pressure at a local thermodynamic state and may result in huge damage to the hydraulic machinery. Cavitation in cryogenic liquids is widely present in contemporary science, and the characteristics of cryogenic cavitation are quite different from those of water due to thermal effects and strong variations in fluid properties. The present paper reviews recent progress made toward performing experimental measurements and developing modeling strategies to thoroughly investigate cryogenic cavitation. The thermodynamic properties of cryogenic fluids are first analyzed, and different scaling laws for thermal effects estimation are then introduced. As far as cryogenic cavitation experimental research is concerned, the progress made in the cavitation visualization and cavity dynamics and the synchronous measurements of the multi-physical field are mainly introduced. As for the study on numerical simulation of cryogenic cavitation, the commonly used cavitation models and turbulence models are, respectively, classified and presented, and the modifications and improvements of the cavitation model and turbulence model for thermal effect modeling of cryogenic cavitation are examined. Then, several advances of critical issues in cryogenic fluid cavitation research are reviewed, including the influences of thermal effects, unsteady shedding mechanisms, cavitation–vortex interactions, and cavitation-induced vibration/noise. This review offers a clear vision of the state-of-the-art from both experimental and numerical modeling viewpoints, highlights the critical study developments and identifies the research gaps in the literature, and gives an outlook for further research on cryogenic cavitation.},

  abstract  = {Cryogenic piston pumps are commonly found in cryogenic systems to pressurize low-temperature liquefied fuels, such as liquified natural gas (LNG) or hydrogen, which are then gasified and stored in high-pressure vessels. The main challenges to be tackled in the design of these machines concern the low operating temperatures, high discharge pressures, and especially the need to avoid liquid evaporation, as this can lead to a reduction of volumetric efficiency or even to the shutdown of the pump. Two effects can cause the formation of vapor bubbles: cavitation, i.e., when the static pressure falls below the saturation value during the suction phase, and evaporation due to a temperature increase of the cryogenic liquid.
In this study, a numerical analysis of a cryogenic single-piston pump is carried out. In the first part of the activity, the suction phase is studied through three-dimensional, steady-state CFD simulations. The performance of the pump in terms of pressure losses is evaluated and possible improvements to the suction geometry are identified.
Then, two-phase steady-state Eulerian-Eulerian simulations are performed. The Rayleigh-Plesset model is used in order to evaluate the onset of cavitation. The minimum inlet pressure conditions that avoid cavitation are identified for two different geometries underlining the positive effect of the introduced modifications. Results show that the methodology applied in this work can lead to improvements in cryogenic pump design, reducing the static pressure losses and hence limiting the risk of cavitation.},

  title     = {2023 EELS Field Tests at Athabasca Glacier as an Icy Moon Analogue Environment},
  year      = {2024},
  abstract  = {JPL is developing a versatile and highly intelligent Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS) robot that would enable access to subsurface oceans and near-surface liquid reservoirs through existing conduits, such as the vents at the south pole of Enceladus or the putative geysers on Europa. A key mobility requirement for future vent exploration missions will be the ability to carefully descend and hold position in the vent to collect and analyze samples while withstanding plume forces without human intervention. Furthermore, this must be accomplished in a highly uncertain environment, requiring versatile hardware and intelligent autonomy. To work towards that goal, we have prototyped the EELS 1.0 and EELS 1.5 robots for horizontal and vertical mobility, respectively, in icy terrain. Autonomous surface mobility of EELS 1.0 was previously validated in a variety of terrain, including snowy mountains, ice rinks, and desert sand. Vertical mobility of EELS 1.5 was developed on laboratory ice walls. This paper presents the first mobility trials for both robots on large-scale, natural icy terrain: the Athabasca Glacier located in Alberta, Canada, a terrestrial analogue to the surfaces and subsurfaces of icy moons. This paper provides a preliminary written record of the test campaign’s four major trials: 1) surface mobility with EELS 1.0, 2) vertical mobility with EELS 1.5, 3) science instrument validation, and 4) terramechanics experiments. During this campaign, EELS 1.5 successfully held position and descended ~1.5 m vertically in an icy conduit and EELS 1.0 demonstrated surface mobility on icy surfaces with undulations and slopes. A miniaturized capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument built to the form factor of an EELS module was tested in flowing water on the glacier and successfully demonstrated automated sampling and in-situ analysis. Terramechanics experiments designed to better understand the interaction between different ice properties and the screws that propel the robot forwards were performed on horizontal and vertical surfaces. In this paper we report the outcomes of the four tests and discuss their implications for potential future icy missions. The field test also demonstrated EELS’s ability to support Earth science missions. Another potential near-term follow-on could be a technology demonstration on the Moon. This paper is a high level report on the execution of the field test. Data and results will be detailed in subsequent publications.},

Jets of fine icy particles that supply Saturn's E ring emanate from this province, carried aloft by water vapor probably venting from subsurface reservoirs of liquid water.

  abstract  = {Many areas of scientific interest in planetary exploration, such as lunar pits, icy-moon crevasses, and Martian craters, are inaccessible to current wheeled rovers. Rappelling rovers can safely traverse these steep surfaces, but require techniques to navigate their complex terrain. This dynamic navigation is inherently time-critical and communication constraints (e.g. delays and small communication windows) will require planetary systems to have some autonomy.Autonomous navigation for Martian rovers is well studied on moderately sloped and locally planar surfaces, but these methods do not readily transfer to tethered systems in non-planar 3D environments. Rappelling rovers in these situations have additional challenges, including terrain-tether interaction and its effects on rover stability, path planning and control.This paper presents novel traversability analysis and path planning algorithms for rappelling rovers operating on steep terrains that account for terrain-tether interaction and the unique stability and reachability constraints of a rapelling system. The system is evaluated with a series of simulations and an analogue mission. In simulation, the planner was shown to reliably find safe paths down a 55 degree slope when a stable tether-terrain configuration exists and never recommended an unsafe path when one did not. In a planetary analogue mission, elements of the system were used to autonomously navigate Axel, a JPL rappelling rover, down a 30 degree slope with 95% autonomy by distance travelled over 46 meters.},

Unavailability of high resolution visual datasets (either bird-eye view or point-of-view from a lander) is an obstacle for selection, verification or development of perception systems. We attempt to alleviate this problem by: 1) proposing Graphical Utility for Icy moon Surface Simulations (GUISS) framework, for versatile stereo dataset generation that spans the spectrum of bulk photometric properties, and 2) focusing on a stereo-based visual perception system and evaluating both traditional and deep learning-based algorithms for depth estimation from stereo matching. The surface reflectance properties of icy moon terrains (Enceladus and Europa) are inferred from multispectral datasets of previous missions. With procedural terrain generation and physically valid illumination sources, our framework can fit a wide range of hypotheses with respect to visual representations of icy moon terrains. This is followed by a study over the performance of stereo matching algorithms under different visual hypotheses. Finally, we emphasize the standing challenges to be addressed for simulating perception data assets for icy moons such as Enceladus and Europa.

Collected at a sub‐spacecraft altitude of 412 km while the surface was illuminated only by Jupiter‐shine (incidence angle: 48–51°), the SRU image reveals a 3 × 104 km2 region between ∼0°–6°N and 43.5°–51°W in remarkable detail at the highest resolution to date. Prior coverage by Galileo under high‐sun conditions at 1 km resolution led to the characterization of the terrain as ridged plains with undifferentiated linea. The SRU image reveals a much richer and more complex picture. Intricate networks of cross‐cutting ridges and lineated bands surround an intriguing 37 km (east‐west) by 67 km (north‐south) chaos feature with a concentric fracture system, depressed matrix margins, and low‐albedo materials potentially associated with brine infiltration. The morphology and local relief of the chaos feature are consistent with formation in the collapse of ice overlying a salt‐rich lens of subsurface water. Low‐albedo deposits, similar to features previously associated with hypothesized cryovolcanic plume activity, flank nearby ridges. The SRU's high‐resolution view of many types of features in a single image allows us to explore their regional context and greatly improve the geologic mapping of this part of Europa's surface. The image reveals several relatively youthful features in a potentially dynamic region, providing baselines for candidate locations that future missions can investigate for present day surface activity.},

A higher bound on this likelihood is set by the potential for radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) power sources, the hottest possible landed element, to melt through the ice shell and reach the ocean. In this study, we quantify this potential as a function of three key parameters: surface temperature, ice shell thickness (i.e., heat flux through the shell), and thickness of a porous (insulating) snow or regolith cover. Although the model we describe can be applied to any ocean world, we present results in the context of a landed mission concept to the south polar terrain of Saturn's moon Enceladus. In this particular context, we discuss planetary protection considerations for landing site selection. The likelihood of forward microbial contamination of Enceladus' ocean by an RTG-powered landed mission can be made sufficiently low to not undermine compliance with the planetary protection policy.},
