  abstract  = {Many arachnids use internal hemolymph pressure to actuate extension in their leg joints. The inherent large foot displacement-to-body length ratio that arachnids can achieve through hydraulics relative to muscle-based actuators is both energy and volumetrically efficient. Until recent advances in nano/microscale 3D printing with two-photon polymerization (2PP), the physical realization of synthetic complex ‘soft’ joints would have been impossible to replicate and fill with a hydraulic fluid into a sealed sub-millimeter system. Inspired by nature, the smallest scale 3D-printed hydraulic actuator (4.9 × 10−4 mm3) by more than an order of magnitude is demonstrated. The use of stiff 2PP polymers with micron-scale dimensions enable compliant membranes similar to exoskeletons seen in nature without the requirement for low-modulus materials. The bio-inspired system is designed to mimic similar hydraulic pressure-activated mechanisms in arachnid joints utilized for large displacement motions relative to body length. Using variations on this actuator design, the ability to transmit forces with relatively large magnitudes (milliNewtons) in 3D space is demonstrated, as well as the ability to direct motion that is useful towards microrobotics and medical applications. Microscale hydraulic actuation provides a promising approach toward the transmission of large forces and 3D motions at small scales, previously unattainable in wafer-level 2D microelecromechanical systems (MEMS).},

The paper offers a calculation formula for the estimation of hydraulic resistance (losses) for hydraulic calculation of multi-phase cryogenic pipelines in the presence of thermal exchange with environment when pressure losses are associated with the force of gravity and friction.},

  abstract  = {Cavitation occurs as the fluid pressure is lower than the vapor pressure at a local thermodynamic state and may result in huge damage to the hydraulic machinery. Cavitation in cryogenic liquids is widely present in contemporary science, and the characteristics of cryogenic cavitation are quite different from those of water due to thermal effects and strong variations in fluid properties. The present paper reviews recent progress made toward performing experimental measurements and developing modeling strategies to thoroughly investigate cryogenic cavitation. The thermodynamic properties of cryogenic fluids are first analyzed, and different scaling laws for thermal effects estimation are then introduced. As far as cryogenic cavitation experimental research is concerned, the progress made in the cavitation visualization and cavity dynamics and the synchronous measurements of the multi-physical field are mainly introduced. As for the study on numerical simulation of cryogenic cavitation, the commonly used cavitation models and turbulence models are, respectively, classified and presented, and the modifications and improvements of the cavitation model and turbulence model for thermal effect modeling of cryogenic cavitation are examined. Then, several advances of critical issues in cryogenic fluid cavitation research are reviewed, including the influences of thermal effects, unsteady shedding mechanisms, cavitation–vortex interactions, and cavitation-induced vibration/noise. This review offers a clear vision of the state-of-the-art from both experimental and numerical modeling viewpoints, highlights the critical study developments and identifies the research gaps in the literature, and gives an outlook for further research on cryogenic cavitation.},

  abstract  = {Cryogenic piston pumps are commonly found in cryogenic systems to pressurize low-temperature liquefied fuels, such as liquified natural gas (LNG) or hydrogen, which are then gasified and stored in high-pressure vessels. The main challenges to be tackled in the design of these machines concern the low operating temperatures, high discharge pressures, and especially the need to avoid liquid evaporation, as this can lead to a reduction of volumetric efficiency or even to the shutdown of the pump. Two effects can cause the formation of vapor bubbles: cavitation, i.e., when the static pressure falls below the saturation value during the suction phase, and evaporation due to a temperature increase of the cryogenic liquid.
In this study, a numerical analysis of a cryogenic single-piston pump is carried out. In the first part of the activity, the suction phase is studied through three-dimensional, steady-state CFD simulations. The performance of the pump in terms of pressure losses is evaluated and possible improvements to the suction geometry are identified.
Then, two-phase steady-state Eulerian-Eulerian simulations are performed. The Rayleigh-Plesset model is used in order to evaluate the onset of cavitation. The minimum inlet pressure conditions that avoid cavitation are identified for two different geometries underlining the positive effect of the introduced modifications. Results show that the methodology applied in this work can lead to improvements in cryogenic pump design, reducing the static pressure losses and hence limiting the risk of cavitation.},

  title     = {2023 EELS Field Tests at Athabasca Glacier as an Icy Moon Analogue Environment},
  year      = {2024},
  abstract  = {JPL is developing a versatile and highly intelligent Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS) robot that would enable access to subsurface oceans and near-surface liquid reservoirs through existing conduits, such as the vents at the south pole of Enceladus or the putative geysers on Europa. A key mobility requirement for future vent exploration missions will be the ability to carefully descend and hold position in the vent to collect and analyze samples while withstanding plume forces without human intervention. Furthermore, this must be accomplished in a highly uncertain environment, requiring versatile hardware and intelligent autonomy. To work towards that goal, we have prototyped the EELS 1.0 and EELS 1.5 robots for horizontal and vertical mobility, respectively, in icy terrain. Autonomous surface mobility of EELS 1.0 was previously validated in a variety of terrain, including snowy mountains, ice rinks, and desert sand. Vertical mobility of EELS 1.5 was developed on laboratory ice walls. This paper presents the first mobility trials for both robots on large-scale, natural icy terrain: the Athabasca Glacier located in Alberta, Canada, a terrestrial analogue to the surfaces and subsurfaces of icy moons. This paper provides a preliminary written record of the test campaign’s four major trials: 1) surface mobility with EELS 1.0, 2) vertical mobility with EELS 1.5, 3) science instrument validation, and 4) terramechanics experiments. During this campaign, EELS 1.5 successfully held position and descended ~1.5 m vertically in an icy conduit and EELS 1.0 demonstrated surface mobility on icy surfaces with undulations and slopes. A miniaturized capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument built to the form factor of an EELS module was tested in flowing water on the glacier and successfully demonstrated automated sampling and in-situ analysis. Terramechanics experiments designed to better understand the interaction between different ice properties and the screws that propel the robot forwards were performed on horizontal and vertical surfaces. In this paper we report the outcomes of the four tests and discuss their implications for potential future icy missions. The field test also demonstrated EELS’s ability to support Earth science missions. Another potential near-term follow-on could be a technology demonstration on the Moon. This paper is a high level report on the execution of the field test. Data and results will be detailed in subsequent publications.},

  abstract  = {Many areas of scientific interest in planetary exploration, such as lunar pits, icy-moon crevasses, and Martian craters, are inaccessible to current wheeled rovers. Rappelling rovers can safely traverse these steep surfaces, but require techniques to navigate their complex terrain. This dynamic navigation is inherently time-critical and communication constraints (e.g. delays and small communication windows) will require planetary systems to have some autonomy.Autonomous navigation for Martian rovers is well studied on moderately sloped and locally planar surfaces, but these methods do not readily transfer to tethered systems in non-planar 3D environments. Rappelling rovers in these situations have additional challenges, including terrain-tether interaction and its effects on rover stability, path planning and control.This paper presents novel traversability analysis and path planning algorithms for rappelling rovers operating on steep terrains that account for terrain-tether interaction and the unique stability and reachability constraints of a rapelling system. The system is evaluated with a series of simulations and an analogue mission. In simulation, the planner was shown to reliably find safe paths down a 55 degree slope when a stable tether-terrain configuration exists and never recommended an unsafe path when one did not. In a planetary analogue mission, elements of the system were used to autonomously navigate Axel, a JPL rappelling rover, down a 30 degree slope with 95% autonomy by distance travelled over 46 meters.},

The surface reflectance properties of icy moon terrains (Enceladus and Europa) are inferred from multispectral datasets of previous missions. With procedural terrain generation and physically valid illumination sources, our framework can fit a wide range of hypotheses with respect to visual representations of icy moon terrains. This is followed by a study over the performance of stereo matching algorithms under different visual hypotheses. Finally, we emphasize the standing challenges to be addressed for simulating perception data assets for icy moons such as Enceladus and Europa.

Collected at a sub‐spacecraft altitude of 412 km while the surface was illuminated only by Jupiter‐shine (incidence angle: 48–51°), the SRU image reveals a 3 × 104 km2 region between ∼0°–6°N and 43.5°–51°W in remarkable detail at the highest resolution to date. Prior coverage by Galileo under high‐sun conditions at 1 km resolution led to the characterization of the terrain as ridged plains with undifferentiated linea. The SRU image reveals a much richer and more complex picture. Intricate networks of cross‐cutting ridges and lineated bands surround an intriguing 37 km (east‐west) by 67 km (north‐south) chaos feature with a concentric fracture system, depressed matrix margins, and low‐albedo materials potentially associated with brine infiltration. The morphology and local relief of the chaos feature are consistent with formation in the collapse of ice overlying a salt‐rich lens of subsurface water. Low‐albedo deposits, similar to features previously associated with hypothesized cryovolcanic plume activity, flank nearby ridges. The SRU's high‐resolution view of many types of features in a single image allows us to explore their regional context and greatly improve the geologic mapping of this part of Europa's surface. The image reveals several relatively youthful features in a potentially dynamic region, providing baselines for candidate locations that future missions can investigate for present day surface activity.},

A higher bound on this likelihood is set by the potential for radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) power sources, the hottest possible landed element, to melt through the ice shell and reach the ocean. In this study, we quantify this potential as a function of three key parameters: surface temperature, ice shell thickness (i.e., heat flux through the shell), and thickness of a porous (insulating) snow or regolith cover. Although the model we describe can be applied to any ocean world, we present results in the context of a landed mission concept to the south polar terrain of Saturn's moon Enceladus. In this particular context, we discuss planetary protection considerations for landing site selection. The likelihood of forward microbial contamination of Enceladus' ocean by an RTG-powered landed mission can be made sufficiently low to not undermine compliance with the planetary protection policy.},

  abstract = {Tire modeling plays an important role in the development of an Active Vehicle Safety System. As part of a larger project that aims at developing an integrated chassis control system, this study investigates the performance of a 19” all-season tire on ice for a sport utility vehicle. A design of experiment has been formulated to quantify the effect of operational parameters, specifically: wheel slip, normal load, and inflation pressure on the tire tractive performance. The experimental work was conducted on the Terramechanics Rig in the Advanced Vehicle Dynamics Laboratory at Virginia Tech. The paper investigates an approach for the parameterization of the Dugoff tire model based on the experimental data collected. Compared to other models, this model is attractive in terms of its simplicity, low number of parameters, and easy implementation for real-time applications. The relations correlating tire forces with slip ratios were identified by applying zero-phase filtering techniques to the raw test data. Next, an optimization procedure was utilized to extract parameters for the Dugoff tire model from the tire-on-ice drawbar pull coefficient versus slip ratio at certain levels of normal load and inflation tire pressure.

The tire testing machine drum is probably the most common indoor testing machine utilized by the tire industry. Shimizu coated the machine drum in ice so that the variation of the lateral friction coefficient with the slip angle and of the longitudinal friction coefficient with the slip ratio could be tested [8]. Using the same testing facility, Shimizu also explored the effect of various ice textures on the friction coefficient versus slip ratio relation [9]. The influence of operational parameters such as normal load, inflation pressure, toe angle, tread depth, and camber angle on the normalized drawbar pull (named the drawbar pull coefficient) was studied by Bhoopalam via indoor testing of a 16” SRTT tire on ice on the Terramechanics Rig at the Advanced Vehicle Dynamics Laboratory (AVDL) at Virginia Tech [10]. Outdoor tests using the same tire mounted on a truck were also performed to investigate the traction force on ice [11, 12]; it has been noted in this study that a direct benchmarking between the indoor and the outdoor tests results was not possible due to multiple reasons, among which: impossibility to control some of the operational parameters in the outdoor tests, while they were controlled in the indoor tests (e.g., ice temperature and normal load); accurate control of the slip ratio (indoor tests have been performed for very precise slip ratios); vehicle speed (indoor tests can only be performed at low speed). For the parameterization of a tire model it is important to characterize the dynamic performance of the physical tire first. The complexity of the parameterization process, the associated cost, as well as time needed, increase with the number of tire model parameters. The parameterization processes of three popular tire models: Dugoff tire model, Magic Formula tire model, and FTire model, are briefly discussed here. Dugoff tire model, with a low number of parameters and acceptable accuracy of predicting longitudinal and later forces, is quite popular for applications involving vehicle control system design [5, 6, 7]. The parameters of Dugoff tire model have physical meanings, and the parameterization could be completed by referring to typical physical values [5] or by using regression techniques to extract longitudinal stiffness and corner stiffness from the tire testing data. Furthermore, the Dugoff tire model is relatively computationally inexpensive, making it a great candidate for real-time simulations or hardware/ software in-the-loop simulations. The Magic Formula tire model [13] has more parameters than the Dugoff tire model, and its parameters don’t have physical meanings. Optimization of the tire testing data is needed for the parameterization of the Magic Formula. The main optimization method applied to parameterize the Magic Formula, developed by TNO, uses an optimization technique to fit the Magic Formula parameters using the Matlab toolbox [14]. This method requires starting values of the parameters at the beginning of the optimization. Proper starting values of parameters are not easily accessible for combined a slip condition, for example [14, 15]. Therefore, for this case, the global minimum might not be reached, and, as a consequence, suitable parameters of the Magic Tire model may not necessarily be obtained using this method. An alternative optimization method based on genetic algorithms could avoid the unfavorable scenario resulted from improper starting values for combined slip condition, as this method doesn’t need any starting values to launch the optimization [14]. Compared with the aforementioned two tire models, FTire has a large number of tire design, physical, and modal parameters. Because of this fact, the parameterization process is more complex, including: cleat tests, modal tests, simulations of a Finite Element (FE) model, and optimization techniques. Furthermore, tire design data sheets and simple measurements [16] are also used. Three packages, FTire/calc, FTire/fit, and FTire/estimate, assist users in parameterizing the FTire after the modal test and cleat test are done for an initial and partial parameterization [17]. FTire/calc performs simulations of FE model to partially validate the initial parameterization and to provide a first FTire input file to FTire/fit. FTire/fit tunes the parameters of FTire and does the optimization to minimize the least-squares distance of cleat test measurements and the simulation result of the FTire model on a cleat. Finally, FTire/estimate utilizes the well-validated tire data file and extrapolation techniques to tweak the modal and stiffness parameters of FTire. As part of the project Innovative Engineering of Ground Vehicles with Integrated Active Chassis Systems (“Project EVE”), funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 Framework Program [18], this study conducted testing of a 235/55R-19 all-season tire on ice at Virginia Tech for various combinations of tire pressure, normal load, and slip ratio. The relationship between the drawbar pull coefficient and the slip ratio was extracted from the testing data; the results were further used to study the influence of the design of experiment parameters on the traction efforts of studied tire on ice. By applying a genetic algorithm (GA), the drawbar pull coefficient vs. slip ratio relations obtained from the tire-on-ice testing data are then used to parameterize a Dugoff model for the 19” all-season tire. This tire has been selected since it is the tire selected to be used in the EVE projects. The Dugoff model has been selected due to its relatively small number of parameters required and due to its suitability for real-time simulations. The tire model is intended to be used next for real-time tire inflation pressure control, one of the sub-system control strategies of the integrated chassis control for ground vehicles with off-road ability being developed under the Project EVE. The paper has the following structure. Section 2 summarizes the key aspects of the indoor tire-ice testing at AVDL used to collect tire-ice data in this study. Next, observations regarding the testing and the presentation of the processed testing data are included in Section 3. Analysis of the testing data has been done in Section 4, discussing aspects of the effects of the inflation pressure and of the normal load on the traction performance of the tire on ice. Section 5 contains the description of the Dugoff tire model and its parameterization method. The paper ends with conclusions on the work conducted, presented in Section 6. He et al / SAE Int. J.

  abstract = {Pneumatic tire friction on ice is an under-researched area of tire mechanics. This study covers the design and analysis of a series of pneumatic tire tests on a flat-level ice road surface. The terramechanics rig of the Advanced Vehicle Dynamics Lab (AVDL) is a single-wheel test rig that allows for the experimental analysis of the forces and moments on a tire, providing directly the data for the drawbar pull of said tire, thus supporting the calculation of friction based on this data. This indoor testing apparatus allows for some degree of replication by helping to maintain test conditions and by imposing a desired tire slip; the normal load, camber angle, toe angle, and other testing configurations can also be pre-set, as required. Methods of and issues related to controlling the production of ice and maintaining the conditions of numerous factors for each trial run were also documented. The AVDL terramechanics rig allowed for the collection of data from tests that varied the tire tread, tire inflation pressure, normal load on the wheel, and the slip ratio of the moving tire. This empirical data was then analyzed through the statistical analysis program JMP 8 in order to determine which factors (or combination of factors) significantly influence pneumatic tire friction on ice. The analysis verified that the slip ratio had a significant effect on the observed coefficient of friction, which decreased as the slip ratio increased. The combinations of the slip ratio and inflation pressure and the slip ratio and tire setup also had a significant effect on the observed coefficient of friction. The tests appear to have validated the theory that the drawbar pull and the traction was higher for the tire with tread.},

  abstract = {Jupiter’s moon Europa has a subsurface ocean beneath an icy crust. Conditions within the ocean are unknown, and it is unclear whether it is connected to the surface. We observed Europa with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for active release of material by probing its surface and atmosphere. A search for plumes yielded no detection of water, carbon monoxide, methanol, ethane, or methane fluorescence emissions. Four spectral features of carbon dioxide (CO2) ice were detected; their spectral shapes and distribution across Europa’s surface indicate that the CO2 is mixed with other compounds and concentrated in Tara Regio. The 13CO2 absorption is consistent with an isotopic ratio of 12C/13C = 83 ± 19. We interpret these observations as indicating that carbon is sourced from within Europa. Description Editor’s summary Europa, an icy moon of Jupiter, has a subsurface ocean beneath a crust of water ice. Solid carbon dioxide (CO2) has previously been observed on its surface, but the source was unknown. Two teams analyzed infrared spectroscopy of Europa from the James Webb Space Telescope to investigate the CO2 source. Trumbo and Brown found that the CO2 is concentrated in a region with geology that indicates transport of material to the surface from within the moon, and they discuss the implications for the composition of Europa’s internal ocean. Villanueva et al. also identified an internal origin of the CO2 and measured its 12C/13C isotope ratio. They searched for plumes of volatile material breaching the surface but found a lower activity than earlier observations. Together, these studies demonstrate that there is a source of carbon within Europa, probably in its ocean. —Keith T. Smith Spectroscopy of carbon dioxide ice on Jupiter’s moon Europa indicates an internal origin and determines the carbon isotope ratio.},

Whether these conditions are sufficiently abundant and collocated to support life remains unknown and cannot be determined from Cassini data. However, thanks to the plume of oceanic material emanating from Enceladus’ south pole, a new mission to Enceladus could search for evidence of life without having to descend through kilometers of ice. In this article, we outline the science motivations for such a successor to Cassini, choosing the primary science goal to be determining whether Enceladus is inhabited and assuming a resource level equivalent to NASA's Flagship-class missions. We selected a set of potential biosignature measurements that are complementary and orthogonal to build a robust case for any life detection result. This result would be further informed by quantifications of the habitability of the environment through geochemical and geophysical investigations into the ocean and ice shell crust. This study demonstrates that Enceladus’ plume offers an unparalleled opportunity for in situ exploration of an Ocean World and that the planetary science and astrobiology community is well equipped to take full advantage of it in the coming decades.},

The long legs (relative to the body) are managed by special parallel link mechanisms, which powerfully and effectively drive the leg joints. The leg mechanism is analyzed by its kinematics, singularity, and static characteristics. The leg length and weight of ASURA I is 1.3 m and 27 kg, respectively.

Firstly, we investigated the sequence of leg motions (walking gait) of free-walking beetles to preliminarily understand which motions (leg muscles) are being activated at which timings and for how long. Each beetle leg has three degrees of freedom (DoFs), namely protraction/retraction, levation/depression, and extension/flexion. We then anatomically mapped out and located the leg muscle groups corresponding to each DoF to determine the stimulation sites (electrode implantation sites) for activating our desired leg motions. Silver thin wires were implanted into the muscles and the other ends of the wires were connected to output sites controlled by a microcontroller which allows for the pre-programmed sequential electrical stimulation. Based on the leg motion sequence in the free walking beetles, two types of walking gaits control, namely tripod and galloping were successfully demonstrated. The step frequency, which corresponds to walking speed, is user-adjustable by changing the duration of each stimulation sequence.},

  title    = {A Novel Bio-Inspired Fluidic Actuator for Robotic Applications},
  year     = {2014},
  abstract = {Biological research on the spider leg mechanism has inspired the development of a novel hinge joint actuator with an antagonistic fluid system. Current bio-inspired robot systems with fluidic muscles can provide a higher power density than conventional piston-cylinder assemblies with the same working pressure and diameter. But like conventional robot arms, current fluidic systems work with the same structural concept: stability is provided by a framework of beams and links while the actuators are placed upon it. A more efficient, lightweight principle can be found in spider legs. An exoskeletal architecture of stiff, tube-like limbs and flexible joint membranes comprise the primary structure, which is filled with hemolymph and muscles. The two most important joints of biological spider legs are extended hydraulically by an increase in fluidic pressure, whereas flexion is performed by the muscles. Recent data from biological studies show that this counterplay of hydraulic extension and muscular flexion is the source of spiders’ incomparably lightweight and powerful legs. Furthermore, the exoskeleton protects the sensitive acting parts and ensures functionality even in harsh conditions or environments. The presented fluidic joint actuator exemplifies the technical application of this unique system. A stiff exoskeleton, with an inflatable joint membrane is constantly filled with fluid pressure, which creates the default extension of the joints. In addition, a fluidic muscle, with a higher pressure, is integrated into this “low pressure domain” and connected to the limb. The muscle is filled to generate flexion. So the counterplay of passive “high cross-section–low pressure” extension and actively controlled “low cross-section–high differential pressure” flexion makes a novel, dynamic rotary actuation system possible. Moreover, balancing the two pressure levels allows individual, case-based adjustments and increases the energy efficiency of the system.},

  title    = {Bionic Water Hydraulic System of Soft Robot Control Inspired by Spider Limbs},
  year     = {2021},
  abstract = {Advancement in technology has seen to a rise in applications of soft robots and the demands for their control are also growing. At present, the pressure control system is bloated and slow to respond, which makes the continuous control of soft robot based on pressure-driven more difficult than that of the rigid. In nature, arthropods use the combination of fluid resistance in blood vessels and lymphatic vessels to achieve limbs bending, which provide inspirations for the control of soft robots. In this study, based on the spider limb control, six proportional solenoid valves are designed, each of which can be quickly connected with other valves to form the required hydraulic bridge. Based on theoretical analysis and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, the pressure control characteristics of type A, B, and C hydraulic Bridges are presented. Through experiments, the relationship between pressure and control current is found to verify the relevant features of the hydraulic system. Because of the good pressure control characteristics of the C-bridge, it is used to drive the soft robotic arm. The experimental results show that this water hydraulic system can control soft robots continuously.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a four-legged bionic robot based on leg reorganization with the hunter spider as the bionic research object. By studying the biological structure of the hunter spider, its movement mode, and the characteristics of limb movement during the conversion process is analyzed and the principle of wheel and foot conversion of the robot is obtained. The three-dimensional model of the bionic robot is designed, and the overall assembly of the bionic structure model is completed. The rationality of the design of the bionic structure is initially verified by the leg reorganization. The virtual prototype is built by adding constraints to realize the bionic motion simulation, including in-situ rotary motion, foot-wheel conversion motion, wheel motion, wheel-foot conversion motion, foot motion, which provides a theoretical basis for the development of the physical prototype and the selection of hardware.},

  abstract = {: This paper gives the methodology used & working details of an eight leg waking robot named as “SPY SPIDER”. It was named so because it walks like a spider and it used safely for spying purpose. It could be easily used where humans are unable to and gather information through camera mounted on it and send live recording too. It was a useful gadget for gathering information of enemies. The robot was wirelessly connected and controlled by remote control so that one can access the location of the robot at any time. The live updates of the location can also be checked on mobile phone and can be record the live streaming also. The robot was connected to IOT, which send the updates to robot also. The unique thing of this was that it can rotate 360 degree on its location. It can go on different terrains where the normal wheels can’t move which make it useful to it to any planet for gathering its environmental conditions.},
